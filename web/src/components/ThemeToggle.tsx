/*
 * The theme switch.
 *
 * One control with two states rather than a menu of three: there is no
 * "system" here to follow (see `lib/theme`), so a menu would be a dropdown
 * over a single choice.
 *
 * The glyph shows the theme you would get, not the one you are in. A sun on a
 * dark page reads as "make it light", which is what pressing it does; drawing
 * the current state instead makes the button a label you have to think about
 * before you can use it.
